# Tidio Chatbot URL Generation Guide

## Introduction

This guide explains how Tidio likely generates specific URLs for each admin's chatbot, making it easy to embed chatbots on your website. By following these steps, you can have a customized chatbot experience for your website visitors.

## Step-by-Step URL Generation Process

1. **Admin Account Setup:**

   - Start by signing up or logging into the Tidio platform to access the admin dashboard.

2. **Chatbot Configuration:**

   - In the admin dashboard, configure your chatbot by setting up responses, triggers, and customizations.

3. **Unique Identifier Assignment:**

   - Tidio likely assigns a unique identifier or token to your chatbot when it's created. This unique identifier distinguishes your chatbot from others.

4. **Custom Subdomain or Route:**

   - Tidio uses the unique identifier to generate a custom subdomain or route for your chatbot. For example, if your unique identifier is "ABC123," your chatbot URL might look like:
     - `https://abc123.tidiochat.com` or
     - `https://tidio.com/admin/abc123`.

5. **Customization Options:**

   - You may have the option to further customize your chatbot's URL, such as choosing a custom subdomain name or route, depending on Tidio's features.

6. **Embed Code Generation:**

   - After configuring your chatbot and customizing the URL, Tidio generates an embed code or script snippet that includes your unique URL. You can copy and paste this code into your website's HTML to embed the chatbot.

7. **Usage Instructions:**

   - Tidio provides instructions on how to integrate the script snippet into your website. This may include placing the code in your website's `<head>` or `<body>` section.

8. **Security Measures:**
   - Tidio ensures secure communication between the embedded chatbot and its servers. Your chatbot is isolated from others, ensuring data privacy.

## Conclusion

By using unique identifiers or subdomains, Tidio simplifies the process of generating specific URLs for each admin's chatbot. This approach allows for individual customization and a clear separation of chatbot instances, making it easy for admins to embed chatbots on their websites and control their chatbot's behavior.
